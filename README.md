# TypeFlow

**Still in very early stage of development, use at your own risk!**

Web-based minimalist keyboard type speed test, inspired by typewriter. 

## Features

TypeFlow uses a "move text not eye" mechanism. The reference text moves while you are typing, so you won't get lost between lines or get in trouble aligning text if you've got something wrong.
